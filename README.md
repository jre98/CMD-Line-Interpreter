Hello Professor!
This is my assignment 2 submission, this is my *README* and I did this assignment on my own.
This program is, as we know, a command line interpreter that parses user input and then
executes the command in a child thread. One issue that I was not able to resolve in time for
submission is that, if an exception is thrown, the program automatically aborts due to the
uncaught exception error. I tried to find a workaround for it, but everything else I tried,
such as catching the exception just broke the program more, so I figured it wasn't worth it.
Thanks again for all your help!!
